        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          I Come from Chile where I had a career in medical sciences imaging for
          about 7 years. <br /><br />
          In 2018, when i was 30 I decided to visit japan applying for the
          working holiday visa that is only available for people under 31 years
          old. In 2019, while i was in Japan I met my future wife and decided to
          move to Tokyo.
          <br />
          <br />
          Once married and settled in Tokyo I started to work in part time jobs
          and study Japanese, until I decided I would like to start a new career
          path in programming and begin studying for it by my own. Finally I
          joined to the LeWagon web development bootcamp and graduated from it
          in september 2023.
